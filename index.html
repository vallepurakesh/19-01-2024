  <h1 style="font-size: 25px">A. Multiple Choice Voting System</h1>  
        
        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
        Let’s consider that there arem candidates (or alternatives of choice) C1,
C2,...,Cm and n voters E1.,E2,...,En. Each voter classifies all the candidates
or alternatives of choice in a certain order of preference. For example, a
certain voter establishes that the preference is C3 > C1 > Cm >...> C5.
In the preference of each voter, for each pair of candidates (Ci , Cj) one
of the preferences Ci > Cj or Cj > Ci occurs. Candidate Ck will be
considered the winning candidate by simple majority if Ck is the
candidate most preferred in relation to all the remaining candidates. It is
irrefutable that this process chose the best candidate. However it is not
always possible to find this winner due to the occurrence of ties in voter’s
preference. The occurrence of ties among the candidates is due to the
problem of cyclical ordering.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
This phenomenon (ties among the candidates) is known as theCondocert􀂶s
paradox. Condocert, a French mathematician, discovered that the number
of ties among the candidates due to cyclical ordering increases
according to the number of candidates. For instance, simulation studies
showed that, for 5 candidates the probability of occurrence of ties is 0.25,
while for 10, 20 and 30 candidates this probability increases to 0.49,
0.68 and 0.76, respectively (Konno, 1997).

    <h1 style="font-size: 25px;">B. Two-Stage Election With Multiple Candidate List </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
      A two-stage election with the elaboration of a list of multiple candidates
appears to be a lot better than the previous system.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
This kind of election is held as follows:
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
STAGE ONE – The voter votes inq preferred candidates from among the
            <b>m</b> existing candidates and
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
STAGE TWO – The s most voted candidates in stage one are submitted
            to new voting and this time <b>t</b> among the <b>s</b> candidates are chosen. The
candidate with the highest number of votes at this stage wins.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
Simulation results testing various combinations of values (m,q,s,t) reported
that the greatest percentage of winning votes occurs when: q @ m/2 ;
s = 2 e t = 1 (Konno (1997)). Thus in STAGE ONE, half of the candidates  
        </p>

        should be voted, and at STAGE TWO the two most voted candidates are
separated and voted.
        
        </p>
    
    <h2 style="font-size: 25px;">C. Election by Approval or Rejection of Candidates</h2>
    
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
        Knowing that there is no perfect election system, according to Arrow’s
Theorem, the following system was proposed by Brams and Fishburn
(1982):
        
        </p>
    
    <br>
    
    <br>
    
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;"><i>EACH VOTER VOTES FOR AS MANY CANDIDATES AS SHE OR
HE WISHES AND THE CANDIDATE WHO OBTAINS THE GREATEST
        NUMBER OF VOTES WINS.</i></p>
    
    
    <br>
    
    <br>
    
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">This system has the advantage of including all the features of the other
voting systems.</p>
    
    <h2 style="font-size: 25px;">D. There is No Perfect Voting System</h2>
    
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
        The mathematician, economist and social scientist Kenneth Arrow, made
a deep analysis of the principles that should guide a perfect democratic
society. He studied the existing electoral processes and managed to
formulate the Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem.

        This principle, formulated and demonstrated in 1951, had a great impact on
those who believed that democracy is the perfect form of government and that
a social-decision-making process which obeyed the principles of democracy
would be perfect. Due to this principle, Arrow was the third winner of the Noble
Prize for Economics.

        ABC University is reviewing and reorganizing the structure and the contents of
its MBA courses for the next academic year. Particularly, the University’s
MBA courses committee is interested in a new course embodying important
environmental problems according to the interest of state and local government
agencies and local enterprises.

        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
Considering the multidisciplinary nature of this type of course and the innovative
aspects expected for this new course, the committee decided that the purpose
and the structure of the course, as well as the organization of curriculum and the
contents of disciplines should be organized based on the suggestions received
from a wide range of persons interested in this new course.

        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
A task force indicated by the committee to conduct this consulting work
decided to organize a group-decision-making process using the advantages

        The president of a manufacturing company noticed that, reviewing the earnings
reports of the current quarter, the profits were down once again. This was the
third successive quarter in which profits were dropped. During a meeting with
the vice president of operations, the president observed that the primary cause
of poor profits could be found in the operations department. Product inventories
were up, and the unit production cost had increased over the past year. The
quality of the service had not deteriorated over time but union relations had
been getting worse during the past months. The vice president of operations
replied that production costs could be cut and product inventories reduced, but
not without adverse effects on customer service, quality, and union relations.
He suggested that the problem could be solved by more aggressive marketing,
since sales had dropped along with profits.
            
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
The president and the vice president of operations realized that the problem
went deeper than simply cutting back present operations costs and improve
profits. They decided that, to prevent this situation from occurring again in the
future, the company must do a better job of planning, decision-making, and
managing within the operations function. The company must develop a system
of decision making in operations to ensure that the operations department
would consistently meet its cost, quality, and customer-service objectives.
This decision-making system must include better forecasting methods, more
effective control over product inventories, better process design decisions, and
improving quality control systems. The vice president of operations argued that
he needs more decisions from the top, about how much the cost, quality,
delivery, or flexibility objectives would be emphasized.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
The president replied, “We’ve recently completed a five-year corporate plan.
Doesn’t it help answer your questions?”
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
The vice president observed that the corporate plan focuses almost entirely on
market analysis and financial planning. It’s presumed that operations will meet
the marketing and financial goals which have been set. The market strategy and
the financial plan are not always consistent with operations strategy and are not
formulated at the same time. Revision of the corporate plan or the operations
goals is essential to keep a dynamic operations strategy, which is an integral part
of the corporate plan.
        
        
        
        </p>

       <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
        
        At this point the marketing vice president walked into the office and said: “I’ve
just returned from our national sales meeting and, based on more recent market
research and government decisions, it appears that sales will be up even beyond
our previous forecast. Last year we lost sales because of stock-outs of certain
key product models, and this hurt us more than we expected. As a result, I’m
raising the forecast for next fiscal year from 100,000 units to 110,000 units.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
The president interrupted, “Just two months ago, we sat here in this office and
agreed on the forecast of 100,000 units. We simply do not have the plant
capacity to produce 110,000 units. And what are we going to do with all of the
inventory if we add the capacity and the forecast does not materialize?”
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
The marketing vice president replied: “Suppose for a moment the new forecast
is correct, what are our options for more plant capacity? Do we have time to
build a new plant?”
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
The operations vice president observed that: “I think our methods of forecasting
are too crude, and something must be done about them. As we all know,
the market is very dynamic in our business. I’m not sure how well the new
computerized quantitative methods available for forecasting will work for us,
but perhaps we should investigate them.”
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
Operations management seeks to produce goods and services at low cost, but
with good quality, and acceptable, flexible, delivery deadlines. It is believed
that these goals are reached by employing modern equipment, a good information
system, satisfied workers, and a team of competent administrators.
        
However, these objectives conflict among themselves and it is not possible to
optimize these four dimensions (cost, quality, delivery, and flexibility) at the
same time. A negotiated decision is always necessary.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;display: block;margin: 20px;">
To take precautions against this type of situation (consecutive drops in profits),
the vice president of operations must have an efficient system to review and
improve the planning, programming, and control procedures of production. It
is necessary to identify the critical production points, utilizing the company’s
best available information. How much should one sacrifice the other three
objectives to reduce production costs? It is necessary to adopt a strategic
corporate decision to focus on the critical production points and better adjust
the four objectives.
